## Welcome to Workbook 00!

Similar to what you did in **Lesson 00**, lease click the big green "Code" button and click "Open in GitHub Desktop" (which you now have installed, correct?). If you are on Windows or macOS, then you should see "Open in GitHub Desktop". * Be sure to clone the repo to your "pycode" directory.

Once you have cloned this repo, be sure to clone the Workbook_00_Submission repo, located here:

https://github.com/StructuralPython/Workbook_00_Submission

Do not worry! You do not need to "know Python" to do this. It is kind of just like using commands to perform a beam analysis.

* If you are doing this course on Linux, you will have to copy the HTTPS link and use it to clone the repo manually in GitHub Desktop.

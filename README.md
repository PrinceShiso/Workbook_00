# Welcome to Workbook 00!

Similar to what you did in **Lesson 00**, please click the big green "Code" button and click "Open in GitHub Desktop". If you are on Windows or macOS, then you should see "Open in GitHub Desktop" under the "Code" button. If you are on Linux, then you will have to copy/paste the HTTPS URL into GitHub Desktop.

Before you clone the repo, create a directory called "Workbooks" in your "pycode" directory. Then clone the repo to this new "Workbooks" directory.
